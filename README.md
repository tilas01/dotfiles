# Dotfiles

These dotfiles are for my laptop or a desktop system and still need to be confirmed as valid with my laptop as I pushed these from my VM.
If there are changes they need to be synced to my laptop or removed/fixed.

If using a VM add the xrandr line to the .xinitrc file as specified in my DWM guide for me
